<h2>Kim Dokja</h2>
<h2><p>Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint</p></h2>
<h3>Revision third</h3>
<h4>Sheoul dome</h4>
    <p>
        After a short time, the party members managed their equipment while waiting for Kim Dokja.; <br>
        Jihye changed her blade and asked Jung Heewon, "Is Dokja ahjussi being serious? Really destroying Olympus..." <br>
        "Still, we don't know where he has been for three years. Do you know the last three years?" <br>
        "...I understand. I'm not a fool." <br>
        "We might not know where he has been for three years but if we look at Master..." <br>
        The speaking Lee Jihye quickly shut her mouth as she felt Yoo Jonghyuk's gaze from a distance. <br>
        Heewon sighed at Lee Jihye before glancing at the meeting room that Kim Dokja entered.
    </p>
Two people were sitting in a private room reminiscent of the reception room of a detention centre. <br>
"It's been three years." <br>
"...It took me longer than I thought." <br>
Kim Dokja watched Lee Sookyung and locked his lips several times. <br>
There were many things to say but some were buried in the layers of  <br>
scenarios and others were missed by time passing. <br>
"That..." In the tomb of a bygone story, a word was barely excavated. "I'm sorry." <br>
Lee Sookyung smiled and wondered,  <br>
"Are you thinking of leaving for the next scenario?" <br>
"Yes."<br>
"When?" <br>
"This evening." Kim Dokja kept his mouth shut for a moment before asking, "Will you go with me?" <br>
"I still have a lot of work to do here." <br>
Lee Sookyung gazed out the window at the industrial complex.  <br>
Kim Dokja followed Lee Sookyung's gaze and looked out the window. They were women who had once been prisoners in this society. <br>
There were Cho Youngran who had Jeon Woochi as her sponsor and Lee Boksoon who fought with him on Fishland. <br>
"There are more people than you think who make the wrong choice because they are attracted to greater power."<br>
The criminals who left prison were now fighting for people. <br>
"The important thing is that people can change. Perhaps now they are getting the opportunity." <br>
Lee Sookyung's voice was sneering at herself. Lee Sookyung turned her head and stared into her son's eyes.
